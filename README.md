# PEOPLE IN SPACE üõ∞Ô∏èüßë‚ÄçüöÄ

**People in Space** is a Python script that uses the [Open Notify API](http://open-notify.org/Open-Notify-API/People-In-Space/) and a graphical user interface (GUI) to tell you how many people are currently in space in real time!

When you run the script, a window will open displaying the real-time number of people in space.

If you click on "Names and Details," another window will open with a table containing a detailed list of astronauts, including their names and the spacecraft they are on.
